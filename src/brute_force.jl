    brute_foece(n, M=ceil(Int, n * n / 5):(n*n))

	Finds the minimum number of "1"s required to cover a square matrix of side
length n. It does this by first looking for any covered boards with 1 "1" on 
them, then any board with 2 "1"s, etc... If at any point it finds one, it 
returns immediatly, because it always exhausts boards with fewer "1"s first,
therefore the first covered board it finds must be a minimal one.
